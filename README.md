Hello folks! This is a Full Stack minimalist Website that allows us to test our
local blockchain

        The complete code is indexed in the files!

        ## Warning 1: Fun fact!!! You are deploying to a local network, then you'll need a local
        network running to interact!

        ## Warning 2: These accounts, and their private keys, are publicly
        known. Any funds sent to them on Mainnet or any other live network WILL
        BE LOST.

        ## Warning 3: We don't use real ETH in this repo.

        That`s it. Let's rock the Web3 Universe!

In this project we will be using HTML / JavaScript in conjuction with Smart Contracts in Ethereum to build this Website (WEB3).

Later on, we will be using Next.js /React.js to advance this project.

This is Step 8 of the full course "Learn Blockchain, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript - 32 Hours Course, from freeCodeCamp.

I am Germano Costa, a UX Designer diving into Web3 Development!

Again, a huge thanks to Patrick Collins and freeCodeCamp for the amazing training and resources! You guys rock!
